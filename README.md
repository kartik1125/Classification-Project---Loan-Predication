# Classification-Project---Loan-Predication
# This repository contains various ML based classification algorithm experimented on Bank Dataset. Also, optimization techniques are implemented to improve the model
# Dataset - The dataset has been taken from Kaggle name of Loan Prediction Dataset
# Dataset - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset)
# Attributes -
# 1- Loan_ID  
# 2-Gender
# 3-Married 
# 4-Dependents
# 5-Education 
# 6-Self_Employed
# 7-ApplicantIncome
# 8-CoapplicantIncome
# 9-Loan Amount
# 10-Loan_Amount_Term 
# 11-Credit_History 
# 12-Property_Area
# 13-Loan_Status
# Problem Statement - 
# We have to predict whether a loan is approved or not based on the customer's profile using key features such as applicant income, credit history, etc.
# Problem Type - Classification(Since the response variable(Loan_status) are categorical)
# Approach Used-
# 1- Exploratory data analysis - a) Descriptive Statistics - Five point summary b) Boxplot - Treatment for Outliers c) Heatmap - Correlation
# 2- Data preprocessing - a) Feature importance b) Scaling c) Missing values d) Train and test split e) K-fold cross Validation
# 3- Modelling -
# 1. Logistics Regression 
# 2. Support Vector Classifier
# 3. Decision Tree Classifier
# 4. Random Forest Classifier
# 5. Gradeient Boosting Classifier
# 4-Optimization (Model improvement) Techniques used- 
# Randomized search cv (for optimality)
